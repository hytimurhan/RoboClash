Ghunankhan Champion of Spaces Nomads ( Wizard )
Melee & Ranged
Atacker

Health 8

Over the years, Ghunankhan has attacked trade ships between the Martian colonies and planet
earth and looted many stations in space. Thanks to his fame, many warriors began to join him,
and as a group they called their selfs "the space nomads". They took over a giant space station
and became a state almost. They sided with the states of the world in the operation to the
colonies of Mars and all their crimes were forgiven. Ghunankhan, on the other hand, decided to
protect his reputation by fighting in RoboClash tournaments at the end of the war.
