Butch was an officer known as the brightest Robo Driver in the North
Atlantic Union. Despite his great success in the attack on the Martian
 Colonies, he got tired of the attitude in the army after the defeat and
decided to leave. After serving as a mercenary for a while, he participated
in RoboClash Tournaments as a driver. He is one of the most feared names in the
arena right now.
